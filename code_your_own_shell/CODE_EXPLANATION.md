## exec.c

The execve() system call takes three arguments: the first is the path to the new program file to be executed, the second is an array of character pointers to the arguments to be passed to the new program, and the third is an array of character pointers to the environment variables to be passed to the new program.

In this program, the argv array contains three arguments: "/bin/ls" which is the path to the ls command, "-l" which is an option to the ls command to display the list of files in long format, and "/usr/" which is the directory to list. The NULL argument at the end of the array is used to indicate the end of the arguments list.

The printf() function is used to print a message before and after the execve() call, but because execve() replaces the current process with the new process, the second printf() statement will never be reached.

If execve() fails, it returns -1 and sets the errno variable to indicate the error. The perror() function is used to print a human-readable error message to the console.
